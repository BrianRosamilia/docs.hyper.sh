# What is HyperServe

[HyperServe](hyperserve.io) is a secure container service. It is the same team behind [Hyper](hyper.sh), who build HyperServe. Simply put, Hyper is a virtualized container runtime. It leverages Intel VT technology to launch Docker images. Therefore, each Hyper container enjoys the same hardware-enforced isolation as in VM.

Due to the hypervisor nature, HyperServe unites more virtualization technologies to deliver the secure and reliable architecture:

- Distributed Relicated Block Storage for Container Volume
- Software-Defined Network for Container Network

With the industry-grade security, you can safely deploy your containers in HyperServe, without the concern of multi-tenancy.
