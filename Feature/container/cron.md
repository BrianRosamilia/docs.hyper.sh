# Cron

In Hyper.sh, cron is a system service that runs scheduled jobs at given intervals or times, just like the cron unix service but work with the containers. 

## Cron expression
The reference documentation for this implementation is found at [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression), which I copy/pasted here with modifications where this implementation differs:

	Field name     Mandatory?   Allowed values    Allowed special characters
	----------     ----------   --------------    --------------------------
	Minutes        Yes          0-59              * / , -
	Hours          Yes          0-23              * / , -
	Day of month   Yes          1-31              * / , -
	Month          Yes          1-12 or JAN-DEC   * / , -
	Day of week    Yes          0-6 or SUN-SAT    * / , -
	Year           No           1970â€“2099         * / , -

### Asterisk ( * )

The asterisk indicates that the cron expression matches for all values of the field. E.g., using an asterisk in the 4th field (month) indicates every month.

### Slash ( / )

Slashes describe increments of ranges. For example 3-59/15 in the minute field indicate the third minute of the hour and every 15 minutes thereafter. The form */... is equivalent to the form "first-last/...", that is, an increment over the largest possible range of the field.

### Comma ( , )

Commas are used to separate items of a list. For example, using MON,WED,FRI in the 5th field (day of week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

### Hyphen ( - )

Hyphens define ranges. For example, 2000-2010 indicates every year between 2000 and 2010 AD, inclusive.


## Examples

Create a cron job which will ping an address every 5 minutes:

	$hyper cron create  --minute=*/5 --hour=* --name test-cron-job1 busybox ping -c 3 8.8.8.8

Check cron job list:

	$ hyper cron ls
	Name               Schedule            Image               Command
	test-cron-job1     */5 * * * *         busybox             ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
	
Check cron job execution history:
    
    $ hyper cron history test-cron-job1
    Container                   Start                           End                             Status              Message

    test-cron-job1-1479267000   2016-11-16 03:30:00 +0000 UTC   -                               -                   Job[test-cron-job1] is running at 2016-11-16 03:30:00 +0000 UTC

Remove a cron job:

    $ hyper cron rm test-cron-job1
    test-cron-job1
    
## Notes
* The user can specify when to send notify email with `--mail` option, such as `on-failure`(default), `all` and `on-success`.
* It will send notification emails to the user's account email if the user does not set email via `mailto` option.
* It will only send notify email with last 100 lines log for cron job container.
* The cron service may be maintained and upgraded, this may cause the users' cron jobs failed to execute. It will send a missed schedule email to user.
* The cron job's containers which were finished will be removed every minute, since Hyper.sh has quota limit.
* When the cron job container finished, cron service will try to get `ExitCode` of that cron job containers.  The cron job's status will be `failed` if the `ExitCode` is not 0.
* All timestamps of cron service will base on UTC timezone.
* If the user delete the cron job, the running containers may not be removed, you have to remove them by yourself.
