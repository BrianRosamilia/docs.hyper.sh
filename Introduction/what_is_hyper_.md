# What is Hyper\_?

[Hyper\_](https://hyper.sh) is a secure container cloud service. Different from traditional Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) that run on top of existing Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform (i.e. AWS), Hyper\_ is a native container hosting service, in which **multi-tenants' containers are inherently safe to run side by side on bare metal**, instead of being nested in VMs.
