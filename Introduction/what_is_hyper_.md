# What is Hyper_?

[Hyper_](https://hyper.sh) is a secure container cloud service built on [virtualized container technology](https://github.com/hyperhq/hyperd). It leverages Intel VT technology to apply VM-like isolation in containers. With the hardware-enforced security, different tenants' containers can safely run side-by-side.

Secure container also leads to a very simple developer experience. The need of VM cluster is gone, along with things like capacity planning, upfront cluster expense, VM bootstrapping, scheduling, COE management, etc. As such, Hyper_ works like "**A remote laptop with unlimited capacity**". Developers may launch any number of containers at any point of time, without preparing anything.

Pricing is **Per Second** consumed in Hyper_. Combined with the "**5-seconds**" container deployment speed, Hyper_ offers great flexibility, control and significant cost savings to developers. Application is able to instantly scale up and down in Hyper_, which empowers developers to build **truly on-demand applications**, e.g. Event-driven (AWS Lamda), Big Data, CD/CI, etc.
 
Hyper_ ships the industrial grade solutions:
- Distributed relicated storage for stateful workload
- L2 private network for multi-tenancy
