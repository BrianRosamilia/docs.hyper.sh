# What is Hyper_

[Hyper_](https://hyper.sh) is a secure container service. It is the same team behind [Hyper](hyper.sh), who build Hyper_. Simply put, Hyper is a virtualized container runtime. It leverages Intel VT technology to launch Docker images. Therefore, each Hyper container enjoys the same hardware-enforced isolation as in VM.

Due to the hypervisor nature, Hyper_ unites more virtualization technologies to deliver the secure and reliable architecture:

- Distributed Relicated Block Storage for Container Volume
- Software-Defined Network for Container Network

With the industry-grade security, you can safely deploy your containers in Hyper_, without the concern of multi-tenancy.
