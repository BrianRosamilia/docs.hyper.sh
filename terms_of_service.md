`Last updated on:  April 4th, 2016`

## Your Agreement with Hyper\_

- `1.1` Your use of the Hyper\_ service is governed by this agreement (the “Terms”). “Hyper\_” means HyperHQ, Inc., located at ~~2302 Environ Way, Chapel Hill, NC, 27517~~, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Hyper\_ Service. The “Hyper\_ Services” means the services Hyper\_ makes available through this website, including this website, the Hyper\_ cloud computing service, the Hyper\_ API, the Hyper\_ Add-ons, the Hyper\_ Components, and any other software or services offered by Hyper\_ in connection to any of those.

- `1.2` In order to use the Hyper\_ Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Hyper\_ Services. You understand and agree that Hyper\_ will treat your use of the Hyper\_ Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

- `1.3` You may not use the Hyper\_ Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Hyper\_ Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Hyper\_ Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Hyper\_ Services are not intended for children under 13.

- `1.4` You agree your purchases of Hyper\_ Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Hyper\_ or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

## Your Account and Use of the Hyper\_ Services
- `2.1` You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Hyper\_ Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords, credentials and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Hyper\_ immediately.

- `2.3` You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Hyper\_ Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Hyper\_ in connection with the Hyper\_ Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Hyper\_, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Hyper\_ Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

~~TBD~~- `2.4` Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained in the Hyper\_ Acceptable Use Policy. The Hyper\_ Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Hyper\_ reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in Hyper\_ serving a “quota exceeded” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the Hyper\_ Services (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

- `2.5` You may use the Hyper\_ Services only to develop and run applications on the Hyper\_ infrastructure. You may not access the Hyper\_ Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Hyper\_ or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Hyper\_ Services.

## Service Policies and Privacy
- `3.1` You agree to comply with the Hyper\_ Acceptable Use Policy (the “Acceptable Use Policy”) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.

- `3.2` The Hyper\_ Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Hyper\_ Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Hyper\_’s privacy policies.

- `3.3` You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Hyper\_.

## Fees for Use of the Hyper\_ Services

- `4.1` Subject to the Terms, the Hyper\_ Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at https://hyper.sh/pricing (or such URL as Hyper\_ may provide).

- `4.2` For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Hyper\_ fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Hyper\_ incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Hyper\_’s measurements of your use of the Hyper\_ Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Hyper\_ and only in the form of credit for the Hyper\_ Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Hyper\_ to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Hyper\_ may be shared by Hyper\_ with companies who work on Hyper\_’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Hyper\_ and servicing your account. Hyper\_ may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Hyper\_ shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Hyper\_ reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Hyper\_ Services to you for any late payments.

Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Hyper\_ may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.
 
- `4.4` You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Hyper\_ Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

## Content on the Hyper\_ Services and Take Down Obligations

- `5.1` You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Hyper\_ Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated.

The Add-on Provider of each Add-on is solely responsible for that Add-on, the content therein, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Add-on or your use of that Add-on. You acknowledge that you are purchasing the license to each Add-on from the Add-on Provider of that Add-on; Hyper\_ is acting as agent for the Add-on Provider in providing each such Add-on to you; Hyper\_ is not a party to the license between you and the Add-on Provider with respect to that Add-on; and Hyper\_ is not responsible for that Add-on, the content therein, or any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Add-on or your use of that Add-on.
