`Last updated on:  April 4th, 2016`

## Your Agreement with Hyper_

- `1.1` Your use of the Hyper_ service is governed by this agreement (the “Terms”). “Hyper_” means HyperHQ, Inc., located at ~~2302 Environ Way, Chapel Hill, NC, 27517~~, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Hyper_ Service. The “Hyper_ Services” means the services Hyper_ makes available through this website, including this website, the Hyper_ cloud computing service, the Hyper_ API, the Hyper_ Add-ons, the Hyper_ Components, and any other software or services offered by Hyper_ in connection to any of those.

- `1.2` In order to use the Hyper_ Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Hyper_ Services. You understand and agree that Hyper_ will treat your use of the Hyper_ Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

- `1.3` You may not use the Hyper_ Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Hyper_ Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Hyper_ Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Hyper_ Services are not intended for children under 13.

- `1.4` You agree your purchases of Hyper_ Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Hyper_ or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

## Your Account and Use of the Hyper_ Services
- `2.1` You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Hyper_ Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords, credentials and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Hyper_ immediately.

~~TBD~~- `2.4` Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained in the Hyper_ Acceptable Use Policy. The Hyper_ Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Hyper_ reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in Hyper_ serving a “quota exceeded” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the Hyper_ Services (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

- `2.5` You may use the Hyper_ Services only to develop and run applications on the Hyper_ infrastructure. You may not access the Hyper_ Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Hyper_ or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Hyper_ Services.

## Service Policies and Privacy
- `3.1` You agree to comply with the Hyper_ Acceptable Use Policy (the “Acceptable Use Policy”) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.

- `3.3` You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Hyper_.

## Fees for Use of the Hyper_ Services

- `4.1` Subject to the Terms, the Hyper_ Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at https://hyper.sh/pricing (or such URL as Hyper_ may provide).

- `4.2` For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Hyper_ fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Hyper_ incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Hyper_’s measurements of your use of the Hyper_ Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Hyper_ and only in the form of credit for the Hyper_ Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Hyper_ to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Hyper_ may be shared by Hyper_ with companies who work on Hyper_’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Hyper_ and servicing your account. Hyper_ may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Hyper_ shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Hyper_ reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Hyper_ Services to you for any late payments.

Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.
 
- `4.4` You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Hyper_ Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

## Content on the Hyper_ Services and Take Down Obligations
